# Linux-Assignment-4
* In this repo I'm documenting 25 Linux Questions as a part of Keenable internship. Let's start the adventure with terminal..
  
**Ques 1: Create a directory named "MyFiles" in your home directory. Navigate into this directory and list its contents.**

``` 
cd /home
```
```
sudo mkdir MyFiles
```
```
cd MyFiles
```
```
 ls
```

**Output**

**Ques 2: Copy a file named "document.txt" from your home directory to the "MyFiles" directory. Move the file to a subdirectory named "Documents" within "MyFiles."**

``` 
cd /home
```
```
sudo touch document.txt
```
```
sudo cp document.txt MyFiles/
```
```
cd MyFiles/
```
```
sudo mkdir -p Document
```
```
sudo mv MyFiles/document.txt MyFiles/Document
```

**output**

**Ques 3 : Create an empty file named "notes.txt" in the "MyFiles" directory. Afterward, delete the file.**

``` 
cd /home/MyFiles/
```
```
sudo touch notes.txt
```
```
sudo rm -rf notes.txt
```



**Output**

**Ques 4 : Create a hard link named "hardlink.txt" for the file "document.txt" within the "Documents" subdirectory. Also, create a symbolic link named "symlink.txt" in the same location.**

```
sudo cd /home/MyFiles/documents
```
```
sudo ln document.txt hardlink.txt
```
```
sudo ln -s document.txt symlink.txt
```
**Output**

**Ques 5 : In the "MyFiles" directory, use a single command to list all files that start with the letter "a" and have a ".txt" extension.**

```
sudo ls /home/MyFiles/a*.txt
```

**Output**

**Ques 6: Rename all files in the "Documents" subdirectory of "MyFiles" with a ".bak" extension. Ensure the original file names are preserved.**

```
cd /home/MyFiles
```
```
sudo vim rename.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

rename_extension=".bak"

for file in *; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        rename_file="$file$rename_extension"
        cp "$file" "$rename_file"
        echo "Renamed File $file as $rename_file"
    fi
done
```
```
cd Document
```
```
touch a.txt b c.txt d.txt
```
```
sudo bash ../rename.sh
```
**Output**

**Ques 7: Use a wildcard character to copy all files from the "Documents" subdirectory of "MyFiles" to another directory named "Backup."**

```
cd /home
```
```
cd MyFiles
```
```
sudo mkdir backup
```
```
cd
```
```
sudo cp /home/MyFiles/Document/* /home/MyFiles/backup/
```

**Output**

**Ques 8 :Execute the ls command to list files in the current directory. Save the output to a file named "file_list.txt." Then, use a pipe to filter the output through grep to display only files with a ".txt" extension.**

```
sudo su
```
```
cd /home/MyFiles/
```
```
touch file_list.txt
```
```
cd Document
```
```
chmod +rwx a.txt b
```
```
cd ..
```
```
chmod +rwx file_list.txt
```
```
cd Document
```
```
ls > ../file_list.txt
```
```
grep '\.txt$' file_list.txt
```

**Output**

sudo vim my_notes.txt
```

**Ques 10 :Run the date command and store the output in a variable named "current_date." Display the value of the variable and append it to the "my_notes.txt" file.**

```
cd /home/MyFiles/
```

sudo su
```
```
current_date=$(date)
```
```
echo "current date : $current_date"

**Ques 11 : Edit the Bash startup script (e.g., .bashrc) to set an environment variable named "CUSTOM_PATH" to a specific directory path. Ensure the variable is available in new shell sessions.**
```
vim .bashrc
```
```
export CUSTOM_PATH="/home/MyFiles/Document"
```
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
```
echo $CUSTOM_PATH
```

**Ques 13 : List all files in the "/etc" directory, filter the output to include only those containing the word "conf," and save the result to a file named "conf_files.txt."**

```
ls /etc | grep 'conf' > conf_files.txt
```
```
vim conf_files.txt
```
**Ques 14 : Open the "my_notes.txt" file in Vim. Use Vim's search and replace functionality to replace all occurrences of the word "important" with "critical." Save the changes.**
